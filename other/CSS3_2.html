		<p>A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. 
		Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, 
		and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints
		a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless:
		animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.</p>
		
		<p class="par2">Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from
		a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman 
		to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails - in a gentle,
		19th-century way - against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow 
		Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. 
		Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships,
		and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. </p>

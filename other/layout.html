				<p>
					A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. 
					Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, 
					and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints
					a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless:
					animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.
				</p>
				
				<p class="par2">
					Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from
					a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman 
					to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails - in a gentle,
					19th-century way - against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow 
					Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. 
					Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships,
					and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all.
